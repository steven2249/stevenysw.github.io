## About Me

I am a second-year Ph.D. student in [Statistics at University of California, Los Angeles](http://statistics.ucla.edu/). My advisor is Professor [Oscar Hernan Madrid Padilla](https://hernanmp.github.io/).

Previously, I graduated from [University of California, Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu) with Highest Distinction honors in [Applied Mathematics](https://math.berkeley.edu/) and [Statistics](http://statistics.berkeley.edu/). During my undergraduate study, I worked with Professor [Carl Boettiger](https://www.carlboettiger.info/) as a research intern at [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) and with Professor [Philip Stark](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/) as a research assistant.


## Research
My current research focus is on quantile regression in nonparametric setups. I am also interested in deep learning and its application in computational biology, social science, and economics.
