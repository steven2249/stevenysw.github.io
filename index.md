## ABOUT ME

I am currently a senior at [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/). I will earn my B.A degrees in [Applied Mathematics](https://math.berkeley.edu/) and [Statistics](http://statistics.berkeley.edu/) in May 2019. During my undergraduate study, I worked with Professor [Carl Boettiger](https://www.carlboettiger.info/) as a research intern at [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) and Professor [Philip Stark](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/) as an undergraduate research assistant.

Starting from Fall 2019, I will join [Department of Statistics at University of California, Los Angeles](http://statistics.ucla.edu/) as a Ph.D. student.
